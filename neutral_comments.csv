1,Hey you should make a playlist of all these “codeing projects” videos where you list different projects ideas.
2,They are cringe AF.
3,The only thing that has changed is that Tim grew a beard
4, @amogelangchaane9341  I’ll think about the video. At the very least I should open source the code and put out schematics.
5,"bro how you made logic for soil temperature and moisture levels, switching etc"
6, @kiddhkane  😭
7,This guy is such a typical software engineer. He talks about his projects: “I did this project where I   ….” And every single time: “I didn’t finish that project but it was still cool…”
8,That thumbnail with the 3d elements looks beatiful

20,I read the thumbnail as “Best programming rejects” 😂
21,Whoever is adding the text graphics is misinterpreting what you’re saying: “pre-defying” your code (instead of prettifying”); “text stack” instead of “tech stack”. Just a fly in the ointment of an otherwise decent video.
22,Than you Tim!
23,What do you mean?
24,🤡
25,If you can explain your process in an interview
26,PTSD
27,django is technically full stack on its own
28, @opcon3155  ? by definition django is a full stack framework
29," @notxarbtech1349  dude 

Django is used on server side, Django itself is a back end framework 

Back end is obviously used in both server side and full stack development"
30,This is dank
31,Tim has beard
